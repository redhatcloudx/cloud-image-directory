# RHEL Cloud image locator

This project is a work in progress with a goal of making it easier to find Red
Hat Enterprise Linuxâ„¢ at various public cloud providers.


## Development guide

[Poetry] is used for dependency management and centralized configuration for testing and
linting tools. Start by [installing poetry] and then clone the repository.

After cloning, run the following:

```console
poetry install
```

Pre-commit hooks are used to ensure that code passes the linter checks before you push.
Prepare the pre-commit hooks on your computer by running some commands:

```console
poetry run pre-commit install
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

You can quickly run tests with `poetry run pytest` or run the full pre-commit suite with
`poetry run pre-commit run --all-files`. Or, simply start a commit (such as `git commit -m "Fixed the bug"`) and the pre-commit checks run automatically.

If you need to add more Python packages to poetry, run the following:

```console
# For packages that this project requires in production
poetry add foo

# For packages that are only needed for linting, testing, or development work
poetry add --group dev bar
```

## Running tests

Use poetry to run pytest:

```commandline
# Run all tests, including end-to-end tests that call out to cloud APIs:
poetry run pytest

# Skip any tests that communicate remotely:
poetry run pytest -m "not e2e"
```

## Secrets

End-to-end tests and the CLI both require access to cloud provider APIs.
Secrets must be available via environment variables for each cloud.

### AWS

Access the IAM dashboard inside the AWS cloud console and click _Policies_.
Click _Create policy_ and then click the _JSON_ tab on the next screen.
Paste in the following policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeImages",
                "ec2:DescribeImageAttribute"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Click through the _Next_ buttons, add a name for the policy, and create the policy.

Back on the IAM dashboard, click _Users_ and then _Add users_.
Enter a username on the next screen and tick the _Access key - Programmatic access_ checkbox.
Click _Next_, then _Attach existing policies directly_.
Search for the policy you just created in the list.
Click the _Next_ buttons and finally _Create user_.

On the next screen, copy the access key ID and secret access key.
Both of these credentials must be set as environment variables before end-to-end tests will run and the CLI will function:

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: your access key ID from above
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: your secret access key from above

### Azure

Azure requires multiple environment variables:

* `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: provided when you register your application
* `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: provided when you register your application
* `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: provided when you register your application
* `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: the subscription UUID

### Google

Google requires one environment variable that points to a JSON file or a block of JSON text.

* `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: path to JSON credentials file or a block of JSON credentials text
